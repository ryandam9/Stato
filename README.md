# Stato

Stato is a web application to find the current status of an Oracle Database. Its UI is written in Bootstrap, Google Charts and the backend is written in Python/Flask. 

### Motivation

As Database users, we execute many queries, which are often repetitive to find metadata of a Database. For instance, how much storage is free, what's the load on the database, why this query is running for long,  what's the count of tables in this schema, etc.. We can easily find the answers by writing SQL queries, now the problem is, it is repetitive, boring.  It would be better If we have a tool that provides all this information with just a click, 

Moreover, Oracle DB has hundreds of catalog views/tables that provide valuable information. It would be a good idea to use them.

### Current State

In Progress.
